Construct a class representing a Book, encompassing attributes like name, author, ISBN number,
and total page count, along with a variable tracking the number of pages read. Tasks include
defining constructors for the Book class - one default constructor and another parameterized
constructor initializing all attributes. Values can be hardcoded within the main function.
Additionally, implement a method to update the pages read, triggering a display of "You have
finished the book" when all pages are read. This method should be called from the main
function to monitor reading progress.
