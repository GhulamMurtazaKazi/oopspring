Revise the previous Book class by eliminating the parameterized constructor and enhancing the
default constructor. The revised default constructor should initialize the page count to 1000
and the pages read to 0 using a member initialization list. Generate setter methods for the
remaining attributes and utilize them within the main function to update attribute values. Introduce
a method called "showBookInfo" to exhibit all book details. Invoke this method from the main
function for displaying book information.
