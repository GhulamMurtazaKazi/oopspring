You are developing a cybersecurity framework that has many layers of protection. The
framework includes a SecurityTool representing a generic cybersecurity tool and a FirewallTool
for firewall-specific features.
Class SecurityTool:
The class SecurityTool has the following features:
• securityLevel: to represent the security level of the tool.
• cost: represents the cost of the security tool.
• no of devices: the number of devices that the tool can run simultaneously on.
Implement the following functions within the SecurityTool class:
• A parameterized constructor that sets the attributes based on the user input.
1. The security level can only be “High”, “Medium” or “Low”.
2. The cost of the security tool can never be 0 or less than 0.
• performScan(): a function that prints a message indicating a generic security scan.
Class FirewallTool:
The class FirewallTool has the following features:
• Ports: a list of ports from which network traffic is allowed.
• Protocols: a list of protocols that are allowed by the firewall.
Implement the following functionality within the FirewallTool class:
• A parameterized constructor that invokes the base class constructor and sets the attributes
based on the user input. A firewall cam simultaneously run on only 10 devices.
• generateList( ) is generated by the following way: Take any digit from your studentID
except for 0. For example if you have taken 1 then the next 23 numbers starting from 2
till 24 are your allowed port numbers.
• ProtocolList only allows traffic from HTTPS, FTP, UDP, ICMP, SSH and SNMP.
• performScan(): the function carries out the scan in the following way:
1. If the security level is set to High then only traffic from the port list and protocol list
will be allowed.
2. If the security level is set to Medium then allow all traffic from port and protocol list
along with the next two ports in sequence(for example 25 and 26).
3. If the security level is set to Low then allow all traffic from port and protocol list
along with the next 5 ports in sequence(for example 25 - 30) and from TCP and DNS
protocol.

In your main function perform the scan based on the conditions.
