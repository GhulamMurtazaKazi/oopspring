Write a program that uses composition to implement a game engine. A game engine is madeup
of several components. For example:
a) Graphics rendering engine
b) Input handler
c) Physics engine
You donâ€™t have to write the logic for how these individual components work.

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class graphicrenderingengine{
	//code for this  class
};
class inputhandler{
	//code for this  class
};
class physicsengine{
	//code for this  class
};
class gameengine{
	graphicrenderingengine obj1;
	inputhandler obj2;
	physicsengine obj3;
};
int main () {
	gameengine nvidia;
	return 0;
}
